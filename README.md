# SALT-trippin

There are a lot of road trip companion apps abroad, but In Sweden it is very hard to find such tools.<br>
In order to plan a road trip you would have to gather information from many different sources.<br>
That is why we created Trippin, a road trip planner with a focus on places like camping sites and national parks.<br>
With our app you are able to plan a road trip by setting an origin and a destination, and add your own waypoints along the route.<br>
You can get useful information like fuel cost estimate (in Swedish SEK), distance and travel time.<br>
You also have the possibility to create your own account where you can easily manage your saved trips.<br>

Frontend:<br>
. React - core framework for our SPA<br>
. Sass for styling<br>

Backend:<br>
. Express to store data in the Backend and serve it to the Front end<br>
. MongoDB to allow users to save trips<br>

Other:<br>
. External API - Google Map API<br>
. Our own restful API to fetch data about national parks, camping sites and viewpoints<br>
. Firebase to securely authenticate our users<br>
. Heroku to deploy and host our application<br>

The Team:<br>
We are a group of four developers who met at </salt> in January 2022.<br>
Our mission was clear: learn to code, survive the bootcamp, drink enough water, Oh and TAKE BREAKS!<br>
We are proud to showcase our Graduation project: TRIPPIN.<br>
